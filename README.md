# rushhour
rewriting a rushhour solver to run in c++ and be fully OOP

This was a rewrite of the A* algorithm to solve any given rushhour puzzle board.
As I was rewriting in an attempt to refresh my c++ skills, I believe that the current 
state of the program is likely to be it. All but the A* algorithm have been implemented.
